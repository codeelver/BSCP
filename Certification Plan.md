# Step 1: Complete all the listed practitioner-level labs

Work through all of the labs in the list below, completing each lab in turn. There is no set time frame for completing the labs, but you must be able to do so without requiring access to the solutions provided.

If you're unable to complete the lab you selected, go back to the learning materials and read through the content carefully, working through all the labs in that topic to make sure you're comfortable with the vulnerability class and exploit techniques it covers.

## Step 3: Complete five mystery lab challenges
5
Use the mystery lab challenge below to spin up five practitioner-level randomized lab challenges - you'll have to try and work out how to solve each challenge with no context, exactly as you would when performing recon in a real-world testing environment.

In some of the labs, you have access to your own account with the credentials `wiener:peter`. If you can enumerate usernames, you may also be able to brute-force the login using the following [username](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-usernames) and [password](https://portswigger.net/web-security/authentication/auth-lab-passwords) wordlists.

## Step 4: Take and pass a practice exam

The practice exams are designed to be a realistic test of all your web security skills. They will also allow you to get used to the format the real exam will use. Before you take a practice exam, [read through the exam hints and guidance](https://portswigger.net/web-security/certification/exam-hints-and-guidance) for some tips and advice to help you succeed.

If you are unable to pass a practice exam, we strongly suggest that you work through the steps outlined in this guide again to further hone your skills.

You have two hours to complete your practice exam, which contains one vulnerable application for you to exploit.

Notes from Copilot
Using Burp Suite Community Edition

**What you CAN do:**

- Use the Proxy to intercept, modify, and replay requests.
- Use Repeater for manual request manipulation.
- Use Intruder (with speed and feature limitations) for basic fuzzing and brute force.
- Use Decoder, Comparer, and Sequencer for manual analysis.
- Use the Site map and Logger to organize and review traffic.
- Install some free BApps/extensions.

**What you CANNOT do:**

- No automated Scanner (no active or passive scanning).
- No Burp Collaborator client (harder to detect SSRF, XXE, etc.).
- Intruder is throttled (slower, fewer features).
- No advanced extensions (some require Pro).

**Tips for Success:**

- Focus on manual testing skills: use Repeater and Proxy heavily.
- Use Intruder for small brute-force/fuzzing tasks.
- For out-of-band vulnerabilities (SSRF, XXE), use external services like requestbin.net or interact.sh.
- Use browser developer tools and command-line utilities (curl, etc.) to supplement Burp.
- Take detailed notes and organize findings manually.

**Summary:**  
You can complete most labs and learn all core skills with Burp Suite Community Edition, but you’ll need to work around missing features for automation and out-of-band detection. Manual testing and creativity are key.
